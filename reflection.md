### Accessibility

1. Were you able to complete the exercises on your own or did you use the
   videos or the solutions for help?
   Yes, i was able to complete most of the exercises on my own

2. How helpful did you find the exercises in this section? Was there one
   exercise that was particularly helpful?
   The exercises were very helpful in reinforcing accessibility concepts. The form accessibility task was especially useful because it gave me hands-on experience with labeling, grouping form elements, and using semantic tags

3. Was there something that you wish had been explained better?
   The instructions were clear, but real-life examples of how accessibility changes help users would’ve made it even better.

4. Were there other exercises that might have helped you learn this week’s
   topic a little better?
   Maybe one or two short examples on using ARIA attributes
